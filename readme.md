# HWUM Datathon 2025 - Data Analysis

# Overview

This project analyzes vehicle risk data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to clean, visualize, and extract insights from the dataset.

To prepare for this competition, I had to learn data cleaning, model prediction, and data visualization. All my learning materials are inside the file learning.ipynb.

# Features

1. Load and preprocess vehicle risk dataset
2. Handle missing values and data inconsistencies
3. Perform data cleaning (e.g., standardizing vehicle categories)
4. Generate summary statistics
5. Visualize data distributions

# Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to analyze the dataset: main.ipynb

# Technology used
1. Python 
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

# Data

The dataset used is Vehicle Risk Data (train set).csv.
